Is coding for me is just a professional matter or something more? To be honest I think itâ€™s both. Obviously I'd like to have a good job with decent salary, and to accomplish that becoming a software developer is a no brainer. But there is also an other side. I was inspired to learn coding by my friend who was developing apps for various hobby activities. And I've discovered that coding allows me to build a working things and that bring me a lot of joy.
